== Shortcodes ==

**Primary Shortcode:**  
`[cp_gallery]`  

Examples:  
- `[cp_gallery]` — uses saved settings.  
- `[cp_gallery per_page="12" columns="3"]`  
- `[cp_gallery per_page="20" columns="4" user_id="21053005"]`  

**Legacy Shortcode:**  
- `[wpcontrib_photos]` — fully supported, calls the same handler as `[cp_gallery]`.  

**Attributes:**  
- `per_page` — photos per page (1–50). Example: `per_page="12"`  
- `columns` — grid columns (1–6). Example: `columns="3"`  
- `user_id` — override saved WordPress.org numeric user ID. Example: `user_id="21053005"`  

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/contributor-photo-gallery/` or install via the Plugin Installer.  
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu.  
3. Go to **Settings → Contributor Photo Gallery** and enter your WordPress.org numeric User ID.  
4. Adjust styling (card style, borders, shadow, caption color) and save.  
5. Add `[cp_gallery]` (or `[wpcontrib_photos]`) to any page, post, or widget.  

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I find my WordPress.org User ID? =  
1. Visit: `https://wordpress.org/photos/author/YOUR-USERNAME/`  
2. Right-click → "View Source."  
3. Search for `wp-json/wp/v2/users/`.  
4. The numeric ID following the endpoint is your User ID.  

= Will my settings be preserved when I update? =  
Yes. Settings are stored in a single option (`cpg_options`) and preserved during updates. v2.5.0 also migrates common legacy option keys.

Yes. The plugin outputs predictable CSS classes like:  
- `.cpg-gallery-grid`  
- `.cpg-photo-card`  
- `.cpg-photo-content`  

These can be targeted for custom styling in your theme.
